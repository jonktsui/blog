For a long time I've been wanting to share random tidbits of what I've learned as well as having a place where I can write about anything interesting I've come across as of late.

I hope that my random rantings may be helpful or insightful! Please feel free to share or comment if there's something you'd like me to write about.

Ironically as soon as I got everything setup to start writing about something... I'd get writer's block :unamused:

For now, enjoy a picture of a Sleepy Murdoch!
